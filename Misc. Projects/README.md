Programs of varying length and complexity without overarching theme.

#### `matching_cards.py`
Simulating the matching cards problem: Shuffle a deck of $N$ cards, labeled 1 through $N$. What is the probability that at least one card in position $i$ has $i$ written on it (turning over the seventh card and it has a 7 on it, e. g., but also drawing 1, 2, 3, 4, ...)?  
Solving this analytically gives $1-\frac1e\approx0.63$, which is in fact what the program converges to for simulating the problem often enough. "Often enough" turns out to be at least 10,000 times. I also plot the convergence behavior from 10 to 10,000 replications.
