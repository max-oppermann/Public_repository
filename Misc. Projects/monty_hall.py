"""
Let's you play through the Monty Hall problem with three doors as often as you like.
Car is behind a uniformly random door. Monty deterministically chooses the last non-car
door if the player chose a non-car door and chooses a door uniformly at random if player 
chose the car door initially.
Demonstrates to those without faith in conditional probability that switching > staying.

Original R-code from:
Blitzstein; Hwang "Introduction to Probability." 2019. p. 82â€“83.
Their code only lets you play one round and does not give you your win/loss ratio,
but the code for getting the theoretical proportions (in my main() function) is theirs
almost verbatim.
