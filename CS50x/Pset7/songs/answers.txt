Relatively higher energy and danceability, but middling valence

Unless these values are relative, higher scores in one my not represent user preference,
but the song market that year.
Secondly, the higher up a song ranked, the more their score should count towards the total.
Currently the valence, e. g., of the first and 100th songs weigh equally.
