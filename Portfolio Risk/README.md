Under construction, but this will be a tool that evaluates the risk of a portfolio of stocks, uses historical data to calculate common risk metrics, simulate potential future losses, and visualize risk exposures. It will look something like this:  
- data_fetching.py: Functions to fetch and preprocess data.
- risk_metrics.py: Functions for VaR, CVaR, Sharpe Ratio, ...
- future_simulation.py: Simulations for future returns.
- visualization.py: Creating and displaying plots.
- main.py: Combining functions from each module to output the full analysis.
