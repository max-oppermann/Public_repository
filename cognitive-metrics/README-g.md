The score in a composite is from [here](https://cognitivemetrics.co/), composing the individual scores below which themselves are derived from the tests  even further below (SAT, AGCT, GRE, CAIT) weighted by their *g*-loading and reliability. IQ tests are inherently imprecise with SEs of around 5-10 points, probably more in the tails.  
An IQ of 135 has a frequency of ~ 1/100, 140 ~ 1/260, 145 ~ 1/740, 150 ~ 1/2300.

You may wonder why the composite is higher than the average of the scores. Averaging scores would only make sense if they had a correlation of 1 since they'd essentially be different observations of the same thing. But they are not perfectly correlated, meaning they test slightly different things, meaning the underlying *general* ability must be higher than the ability in the specific subtests.  
Imagine measuring general athleticism via performance in gymnastics and long-distance running. Since the general athletic ability gets diluted by other factors in the specific activities, it will be higher than is measured by those two individual performances.

# SAT, AGCT, GRE

The 1980 SAT, the Army General Classification Test, and the old GRE have a very high *g*-loading. They are considered the gold standard of free tests since they can be normed against an enormous population of test takers.

# CAIT

Inspired by the Wechsler (WAIS), this tests more facets simultaneously, but has a lower *g*-loading. The genuinely new aspects tested here are working memory (digit span) and processing speed (symbol search). The relevant number is the FSIQ at the very bottom.
