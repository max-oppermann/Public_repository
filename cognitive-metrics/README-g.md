The score in this composite is from [this](https://compositator.com/) *g*-estimator (click the first square labeled "Big 'g' Estimator"). "Composite" here means Full Scale IQ (FSIQ) which is the relevant number.  
IQ tests are inherently imprecise with SEs of around 5-10 points, probably more in the tails. An IQ of 135 has a frequency of ~ 1/100, 140 ~ 1/260, 145 ~ 1/740, 150 ~ 1/2300.

You may wonder why the composite is higher than the average of the scores and higher even than the highest subscore. Averaging scores would only make sense if they had a correlation of 1 since they'd essentially be different observations of the same thing. But they are not perfectly correlated, meaning they test slightly different things, meaning the underlying *general* ability must be higher than the ability in the specific subtests. Imagine measuring general athleticism via performance in gymnastics and long-distance running. Since the general athletic ability gets diluted by other factors in the specific activities, it will be higher than is measured by those two individual performances.  
Some more details on specific scores below.  

# SAT, AGCT, GRE
[Link](https://cognitivemetrics.co/)  
The 1980 SAT, the Army General Classification Test, and the old GRE have a very high *g*-loading. They are considered the gold standard of free tests.

# CAIT
[Link](https://cognitivemetrics.co/)  
This tests more facets simultaneously (SAT is only verbal, quantitative, and to some extent processing speed since it is timed), but has a lower *g*-loading. The genuinely new aspects tested here are working memory (digit span) and processing speed (symbol search). The relevant number is the FSIQ at the very bottom.

# Other tests
These are okay-ish tests. Their main value is that they test different kinds of items. They usually have no known *g*-loadings and reliabilities (not even estimates) which is why they don't feature in the composite at the top:  
[Mensa Norway](https://test.mensa.no/Home/Test/de-DE) is progressive matrices, testing abstract reasoning.

The [ICAR60](https://planning.e-psychometrics.com/test/icar60) has many more visual-spatial items than the other tests (shape rotation).

And a final one just because I score highest on it.  
There are no real screenshots for it, but Antjuan Finch provides an [intelligence quicktest](http://antjuanfinch.com/sgiq) (50 items, 12 minutes) and a ["Public Domain Intelligence Test"](http://antjuanfinch.com/pdit) (60 items, 30 minutes). The quicktest only includes quantitative and verbal items; I score 46/50 corresponding to an IQ of 149. The PDIT is one section of verbal items and one of progressive matrices; I score 29/30 on both corresponding to 148 verbal, 142 non-verbal, and an FSIQ of $(0.58(48+42))+100 = 152.2$ ... The test may be inflated at these extremes since this is outside the 95% CI from the more reliable tests at the top. But it could also be the case that the score is skewed *for me in particular* since it tests my three strongest aspects: Verbal, abstract reasoning, and processing speed. If it were an untimed test of visual-spatial ability, like the ICAR60, my score may have been lower even with the same norms.
