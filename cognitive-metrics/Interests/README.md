This is a collection of flashcard decks that forms the backbone of my structured self-learning, representing approximately three years's worth of full-time study (my estimate is 33 months full-time, realistically spread out over a longer time frame of non-full-time work).  

Compiling comprehensive notes and insights, the decks are drawn from a carefully selected mix of textbooks and open courses, reflecting a serious commitment to mastering both quantitative methods and the nuances of political and historical analysis. The decks encapsulate my dual interest in rigorous, quantitative analysis and the study of political and historical systems. They are a testament to the focused and methodical approach I bring both to self-learning and, in the future, to professional endeavors in politics, data science, and beyond.

If you want to look inside, you'll need to install [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) and import the decks. Media are omitted to keep the file small enough. When a deck has an institution in brackets – like (MIT) – it is an open course.


## Economics

- Duflo, *Development Economics* (MIT). On MIT OCW. Graduate course, mostly talking about specific papers rather than general concepts.

- Krugman, *International Economics*

- Mankiw, *Macroeconomics*

- Mishkin, *Money, Banking, Financial Markets*. The textbook "The Economics of Money, Banking, and Financial Markets."

- Stiglitz, *Public Economics*. The textbook "Economics of the Public Sector."

- Tabarrok / Cowen, *International Trade and Finance* (MRU) [Link 1](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-uRhZ_p-BM5OwNpuI6krXG957-6tt2W6), [Link 2](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-uRhZ_p-BM6vqy0uBwWkO9Hb7dTlwPow)

- Tabarrok / Cowen, *Principles of Microeconomics* (MRU) [Link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-uRhZ_p-BM4XnKSe3BJa23-XKJs_k4KY)

- Weimer / Vining, *Policy Analysis*. Could have gone under the Politics header, but they too strongly rely on microeconomics for it to be easily comprehensible for people without some economics background.

#### Metrics

- Duflo, *Data Analysis for Social Scientists* (MIT). Technically marked as a graduate course; probably best thought of as a second quant methods course for social scientists.

- Elsner, *Causal Inference* (UCD). [Link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyvUJLHD8IsJCB7ALqwjRG1BjL5JxE__H). Ben Elsner at UCD structures his graduate course in econometrics as a semi-flipped classroom. Covers IV, RDD, DiD and synthetic controls, the typical causal effects (LATE, ATE, ATT, ATU), and also MTEs.

- Freedman, *Statistical Models*. Statistics for people who know linear algebra.

- Freedman / Purves / Pisani, *Statistics*. A basic introduction to statistics.

## History

- Best, *International History 20th*. Actually four authors: "International History of the Twentieth Century and Beyond."

- Clark, *World Economic History before Industrial Rev.* (UC Davis) [Link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_w_qWAQZtAYqD1KnrMdZ5vpxyNUlq_rr). Gregory Clark covering about 2/3 of his book "A Farewell to Alms."

- Claude (*Religion, Hell, Plato*). Me testing out Sonnet 4.5, asking about some topics I already knew and some I didn't.

- Evans, *History of Empire*. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL96EAE2875AF0EDEA). Richard Evans on the history of European empires, mostly between the 18th and early 20th century.

- Freeman, *The American Revolution* (OYC). [Link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDA2BC5E785D495AB). Part of the Open Yale Courses, barely covers the war itself.

- Hayes, *Introduction to the Old Testament* (OYC). [Link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLh9mgdi4rNeyuvTEbD-Ei0JdMUujXfyWi). What it says on the tin except that she'd say "Hebrew Bible." Extremely dense, very lucid, probably the best course on this list.  

- Kagan, *Introduction to Ancient Greek History* (OYC). [Link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL023BCE5134243987). Very dense and informative except for the military history of the Peloponnesian War, which is lethally boring. 

- Masters, *Modern Middle East* (Wesleyan) [Link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLR6JOitCh_0r2ecobp6j-gynFsh1xYQDh)

- Merriman, *European Civilization, 1648-1945* (OYC). [Link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3A8E6CE294860A24). Light on information. 

## Math/ML

- Blitzstein, *Probability*. The exceptional textbook "Introduction to Probability" by Blitzstein and Hwang. Includes most exercises with solutions.

- ISLP. The textbook "An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in Python," the associated lectures, and the Python labs.

## Misc. Social Science

- Baron, *Thinking and Deciding*

- Dawes / Hastie, *Rational Choice in an Uncertain World*

- Elster, *Explaining Social Behavior*. The 2015 edition; this is the most important book here.

- Nisbett, *Social Psychology*. This is a textbook with more authors; do not recommend.

- Sapolsky, *Human Behavioral Biology* (Stanford) [Link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL848F2368C90DDC3D)

- Wyman, *Global Problems of Population Growth* (OYC). [Link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE60A08636F41C128). Very unique course that covers some biology and modern politics as well. But since it has some overlap with Clark's course, it's in this list. 

## Politics

- Baum, *The Supreme Court*. A textbook about the inner workings of the U.S. Supreme Court.

- Bawn, *Politics and Strategy* (UCLA). [Link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF420ADB3E328425A). A fairly basic introduction to game theory with an eye towards political applications for UCLA political science undergrads.

- Bose / DiIulio, *American Government*. Your run-off-the-mill American government textbook for a first college course.  

- Foreign Affairs magazine. Some articles I thought were interesting.

- Frantz, *Authoritarianism*. Part of the "What Everyone Needs to Know" series, summarizing many quantitative and verifiable aspects of authoritarian regimes.

- Hix, *Political System of the EU*. Textbook that is not so much an introduction to the mechanics of the EU institutions as it is about applying various political science models (mostly rational choice type) to EU politics.

- Larres et al., *Oxford Handbook of German Politics*. Not all chapters.

- Nugent, *Government and Politics of the EU*. Textbook that is an introduction to the mechanics of the EU institutions. 

- Probst, *Politik/Regieren Bremen*

- Shapiro, *Moral Foundations of Politics* (OYC). [Link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2FD48CE33DFBEA7E). An introduction to political philosophy. Very matter of fact, valuing historical philosophers not for being "historically important" but only in so far as they had good arguments.

- Smith, *American Congress*. A textbook about the inner workings of the U.S. Congress.

- Spaniel, *Bargaining 101*, *Bargaining and War*, *Civil Wars MOOC*, *International Relations 101*. [Link to the last one](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB5965C13F4B0B2DA). William Spaniel is a political scientist focusing on formal modelling (rational choice). These relatively short courses work through typical applications to international relations like why war happens at all between rational actors or why they would enter into international organizations like the UN. 

- *Staatsbürger-Taschenbuch*

- Truex, *Chinese Politics* (Princeton). [Link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtC2xxF6af5RtM6KXsKDW6tQUUlHvs61W). Quite fast paced and dense intro to Chinese politics covering mostly historical development, institutional facts, and then some specific policy areas like censorship and ethnic conflict (think: Xinjiang).
