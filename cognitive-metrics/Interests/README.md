These are collections of flashcard decks that form the backbone of my structured self-learning, representing approximately one year's worth of full-time study (realistically spread out over a longer time frame rather than 52 weeks of 40 hours of studying without breaks).  
Compiling comprehensive notes and insights, the decks are drawn from a carefully selected mix of textbooks and open courses, reflecting a serious commitment to mastering both quantitative methods and the nuances of political and historical analysis. The decks encapsulate my dual interest in rigorous, quantitative analysis and the study of political and historical systems. They are a testament to the focused and methodical approach I bring both to self-learning and, in the future, to professional endeavors in politics, data science, and beyond.

If you want to look inside, you'll need to install [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) and import the decks.


### <u>Stats/ML</u>
Around 3,300 notes

- *Blitzstein, Probability*. The exceptional textbook "Introduction to Probability" by Blitzstein and Hwang. It makes up around 40% of all cards in the Stats/ML deck.  
- *Duflo, Data Analysis for Social Scientists (MIT)*. On MIT OCW technically marked as a graduate course; probably best thought of as a second quant methods course for social scientists. I skipped the probability material that was already covered in Blitzstein.   
- *Elsner, Causal Inference (UCD)*. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyvUJLHD8IsJCB7ALqwjRG1BjL5JxE__H). Ben Elsner at UCD structures his graduate course in econometrics as a semi-flipped classroom. Covers IV, RDD, DiD and synthetic controls, the typical causal effects (LATE, ATE, ATT, ATU), and also MTEs.  
- *Freedman, Statistical Models*. Textbook that covers what he thought at the time were all models social scientists needed to know.  
- *Freedman/Purves/Pisani, Statistics*. A very basic first introduction to statistics.  
- *ISLP*. The textbook "An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in Python," the associated lectures, and the Python labs.  


### <u>Politics</u>
Around 5,100 notes

- *Baum, The Supreme Court*. A textbook about the inner workings of the U.S. Supreme Court.  
- *Bawn, Politics and Strategy (UCLA)*. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF420ADB3E328425A). A fairly basic introduction to game theory with an eye towards political applications for UCLA political science undergrads.  
- *Bose/Dilulio, American Government*. Your run-off-the-mill American government textbook for a first college course.  
- *Frantz, Authoritarianism*. Part of the "What Everyone Needs to Know" series, summarizing many quantitative and verifiable aspects of authoritarian regimes rather than moralizing or philosophical musings about what authoritarianism really *is*.  
- *Hix, Political System EU*. Textbook that is not so much an introduction to the mechanics of the EU institutions as it is about applying various political science models (mostly rational choice type) to EU politics.  
- *Nugent, Government/Politics of EU*. Textbook that is an introduction to the mechanics of the EU institutions.  
- *Rosati, US Foreign Policy*. Introductory textbook covering the major players in U.S. foreign policy making (NSC, DoD, State, the intelligence community, and others).  
- *Rudzio, System der BRD (including Probst, Politik/Regieren in Bremen)*. Introduction to the political system of Germany.  
- *Shapiro, Moral Foundations of Politics (OYC)*. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2FD48CE33DFBEA7E). Part of the Open Yale Courses and an introduction to political philosophy. Very matter of fact, valuing historical philosophers not for being "historically important" but only in so far as they had good arguments.  
- *Smith, American Congress*. A textbook about the inner workings of the U.S. Congress.  
- *Spaniel, Bargaining 101 / Bargaining and War / Civil Wars MOOC / International Relations 101*. [Link to the last one](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB5965C13F4B0B2DA). William Spaniel is a political scientist focusing on formal modelling (rational choice). These relatively short courses work through typical applications to international relations like why war happens at all between rational actors or why they would enter into international organizations like the UN.  
- *Stiglitz, Public Economics*. The textbook "Economics of the Public Sector" was the first economics textbook I read, but since thinking about politics at all without this toolkit is entirely pointless it is in "Politics" rather than "Economics" which I didn't upload.  
- *Truex, Chinese Politics (Princeton)*. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtC2xxF6af5RtM6KXsKDW6tQUUlHvs61W). Quite fast paced and dense intro to Chinese politics covering mostly historical development, institutional facts, and then some specific policy areas like censorship and ethnic conflict (think: Xinjiang).  


### <u>History</u>
Around 2,300 notes

- *Best, International History 20th*. The textbook "International History of the Twentieth Century and Beyond." Currently under construction since I'm splitting up cards that were too verbose. Represents about half of all cards in the History deck.  
- *Clark, World Econ History before the Industrial Rev. (UC Davis)*. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_w_qWAQZtAYqD1KnrMdZ5vpxyNUlq_rr). Gregory Clark covering about 2/3 of his book "A Farewell to Alms."  
- *Freeman, The American Revolution (OYC)*. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDA2BC5E785D495AB). Part of the Open Yale Courses, barely covers the war itself (thankfully).   
- *Hayes, Introduction to the Old Testament (OYC)*. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLh9mgdi4rNeyuvTEbD-Ei0JdMUujXfyWi). What it says on the tin except that she'd say "Hebrew Bible." Extremely dense, very lucid, probably the best course on this list.  
- *Kagan, Introduction to Ancient Greek History (OYC)*. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL023BCE5134243987). Very dense and informative except for the military history of the Peloponnesian War, which is lethally boring.  
- *Merriman, European Civilization, 1648-1945 (OYC)*. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3A8E6CE294860A24). Light on information.  
- *Wyman, Global Problems of Population Growth (OYC)*. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE60A08636F41C128). Very unique course that covers some biology and modern politics as well. But since it has some overlap with Clark's course, it's in this list.
